      "LongDescription": "Carbon dioxide emissions, largely by-products of energy production and use, account for the largest share of greenhouse gases, which are associated with global warming. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions result primarily from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing. In combustion different fossil fuels release different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same level of energy use: oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases about twice as much. Cement manufacturing releases about half a metric ton of carbon dioxide for each metric ton of cement produced. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation. The unit of measurement is kt (kiloton). Carbon dioxide emissions are often calculated and reported as elemental carbon. They are converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.667 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).\n\nThe original publisher of this data is The World Bank.

Native AWS Analytics services such as AWS Glue, Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight provide different ways to interact and visualize the data. The included AWS CloudFormation template sets up AWS Glue and Amazon Athena automatically in your AWS account and the documentation below describes how to visualize the data using Amazon QuickSight.\n\n[Automatic Revision Updates - This diagram shows the automatic revision update process](https://rearc-data-provider.s3.amazonaws.com/co2-emissions/public/automatic-revision-updates.png)\n\n[Analytics & Visualizations - This diagram shows how the native AWS services are used for Analytics & Visualizations](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rearc-data-provider/co2-emissions/public/data-analysis.png)\n\n## Deploy automation to set up automatic revision updates and AWS Analytics services\n\nAssuming you have subscribed to this product listing, below are the detailed steps to deploy CloudFormation template:\n\n(*Please note that you will need IAM permissions for CloudFormation, AWS Data Exchange, IAM, Lambda, Glue, Athena and QuickSight,  in order to deploy the CloudFormation template.*)  \n\n- Under the product listing, scroll down to `Data sets` section and click on the Data set name\n- Under the `Revisions` section, click on the most recent revision\n- Under `Assets`, checkmark `co2-emissions/automation/post-processing-code.zip` and click `Export to S3`\n- Choose the S3 Bucket where you would like to store the dataset. Make sure you only choose the S3 bucket. The asset comes with a pre-defined directory structure\n- Under `Assets`, checkmark `co2-emissions/automation/cloudformation.yaml` and click either `Export to S3` or `Export to computer`\n- If you exported the `cloudformation.yaml` to S3, go to the S3 UI on the AWS console and navigate to the location where the `cloudformation.yaml` is stored. In S3, click on the cloudformation.yaml and copy the url from the `Object URL`\n- Now, from your AWS Management Console, log onto Amazon CloudFormation UI and click `Create Stack`\n- Under `Choose a template` either provide the template via uploading from local computer or specify the S3 object url and click `Next`\n- Provide a friendly stack name in the `Stack name` text box\n- In the `SourceS3Bucket` field, input the S3 bucket name that you chose earlier to store the co2-emissions/automation/post-processing-code.zip file\n- Leave rest of the fields as is\n- Click `Next`\n- On the `Configure stack options` page, click `Next`\n- On the `Review test` page, checkmark the `I acknowledge...` boxes\n- Click `Create stack`\n\n### At a high level, CloudFormation will setup following resources automatically.\n- Lambda function to setup automatic AWS Data Exchange revision updates for this dataset\n- CloudWatch Event rule that will automatically trigger the Lambda function every time a new revision update is published\n- Analytics Lambda function to setup AWS Glue and Amazon Athena\n- Necessary IAM roles and permissions\n\nIf you are interested in looking at the AWS Lambda code or the CloudFormation template, feel free to inspect files inside `co2-emissions/automation/post-processing-code.zip` and `co2-emissions/automation/cloudformation.yaml`\n\n*Please note, the code for automatic daily revision updates runs in AWS Lambda using Python runtime. AWS Python SDK (boto3) that comes with the default Lambda Python runtime is currently not updated to support AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace Catalog APIs. Hence, we use a Lambda layer on top of the Lambda Python runtime that extends the AWS Python SDK (boto3) to support AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace Catalog APIs as of November 13, 2019. Once the Lambda Python runtime is updated with a newer version of AWS Python SDK (boto3), we will update the code to remove this Lambda layer.*\n\n## Using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena to run interactive queries against the dataset\n\nOnce the CloudFormation template is successfully deployed, the data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available on Athena. You can go to the Athena UI from the AWS Management Console and run SQL queries on the dataset.\n\n### Here are some sample Athena SQL queries you can try on the dataset.\n\n**# list co2 emissions for all countries for year 2014**\n```bash\nSELECT \"country_name\", \"2014\" FROM \"co2_emissions\".\"data\";\n```\n\n**# list yearly co2 emissions for \"united states\"**\n```bash\nSELECT * FROM \"co2_emissions\".\"data\" WHERE \"country_name\" = 'united states';\n```\n\n**# compare co2 emissions for \"united states between year \"1980\" and \"2014\"**\n```bash\nSELECT \"country_name\", \"1980\", \"2014\" FROM \"co2_emissions\".\"data\" WHERE \"country_name\" = 'united states';\n```\n\n**# compare co2 emissions between \"united states\" and \"china\"**\n```bash\nSELECT * FROM \"co2_emissions\".\"data\" WHERE \"country_name\" IN ('united states', 'china');\n```\n\n## Setup Amazon QuickSight to create visualizations on the dataset\n\nBelow are the detailed steps to analyze dataset using Amazon QuickSight\n- From your AWS Management Console, log onto Amazon QuickSight\n- Click `Manage data`\n- Click `New data set`\n- If you ran the provided CloudFormation template, you should already have your database and table with schema created in AWS Glue and Athena\n- Click on `Athena` to connect to your data source\n- Provide a name for your QuickSight `Data source name` and click `Create data source`\n- In the `Database: contain sets of table` dropdown, choose database as `co2_emissions` and under `Tables: contain the data you can visualize`, choose table as `data`\n- At this point, you can `Edit/Preview data` if you like\n- You can then click on `Select`\n- In the `Finish data set creation` screen, you can select `Visualize` to finish the creation of data set process\n- Visualize the data set by selecting the `Horizontal bar chart` from the `Visual types`\n- Drag `country_name` field to the `Y axis` in `Field wells` and for e.g. drag `2014` field in the `Value` block to chart the data\n\nYou are now ready to start analyzing and visualizing the dataset.\n\n# Contact Information\nIf you have questions about the source data, please contact data@worldbank.org. If you have any questions about the CloudFormation stack, Lambda code or any of the AWS services being used, please contact data@rearc.io.\n\n## About Rearc\nRearc is a cloud, software and services company.

      "LongDescription": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living; the CPI is one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation.\n\nThe original publisher of this data is The World Bank.

Once the public SDKs are updated to include AWS Data Exchange APIs, we will update the code to remove this Lambda layer.*\n\n# Deploy CloudFormation template to set up automatic revision updates and AWS Analytics services\nAssuming you have subscribed to this product listing, below are the detailed steps to deploy CloudFormation template:\n\n(*Please note that you will need IAM permissions for CloudFormation, AWS Data Exchange, IAM, Lambda, Glue, Athena and QuickSight,  in order to deploy the CloudFormation template.*)  \n\n- Under the product listing, scroll down to `Data sets` section and click on the Data set name\n- Under the `Revisions` section, click on the most recent revision\n- Under `Assets`, checkmark `world-bank-cpi/automation/post-processing-code.zip` and click `Export to S3`\n- Choose the S3 Bucket where you would like to store the dataset. Make sure you only choose the S3 bucket. The asset comes with a pre-defined directory structure \n- Under `Assets`, checkmark `world-bank-cpi/automation/cloudformation.yaml` and click either `Export to S3` or `Export to computer`\n- If you exported the `cloudformation.yaml` to S3, go to the S3 UI on the AWS console and navigate to the location where the `cloudformation.yaml` is stored. In S3, click on the cloudformation.yaml and copy the url from the `Object URL`\n- Now, from your AWS Management Console, log onto Amazon CloudFormation UI and click `Create Stack`\n- Under `Choose a template` either provide the template via uploading from local computer or specify the S3 object url and click `Next`\n- Provide a friendly stack name in the `Stack name` text box\n- In the `SourceS3Bucket` field, input the S3 bucket name that you chose earlier to store the world-bank-cpi/automation/post-processing-code.zip file\n- Leave rest of the fields as is\n- Click `Next`\n- In the `Options` screen, click `Next`\n- Tick mark the `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources.` box\n- Click `Create`\n\n## At a high level, CloudFormation will setup following resources automatically.\n- Lambda function to setup automatic AWS Data Exchange revision updates for this dataset\n- CloudWatch Event rule that will automatically trigger the Lambda function every time a new revision update is published\n- Another Lambda function to setup AWS Glue and Amazon Athena\n- Necessary IAM roles and permissions\n\nIf you are interested in looking at the AWS Lambda code or the CloudFormation template, feel free to inspect files inside `world-bank-cpi/automation/post-processing-code.zip` and `world-bank-cpi/automation/cloudformation.yaml`\n\n# Analytics & Visualizations\nApart from the source data, what we are also providing in this product listing is an easy way to interact and extract value out of the dataset. Native AWS Analytics services such as AWS Glue, Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight provide different ways to interact and visualize the data. The included AWS CloudFormation template sets up AWS Glue and Amazon Athena automatically in your AWS account.\n\n[Data Analysis - This diagram shows how all the AWS services interact](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rearc-data-provider/world-bank-cpi/public/data-analysis.png)\n\n## Using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena to run interactive queries against the dataset\n\nOnce the CloudFormation template is successfully deployed, the data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available on Athena. You can go to the Athena UI from the AWS Management Console and run SQL queries on the dataset.\n\n### Here are some sample Athena SQL queries you can try on the dataset.\n\n**# list per country/region CPI data for the year 2017**\n```bash\nSELECT \"country_name\", \"2017\" from \"world_bank_cpi\".\"data\";\n```\n\n**# all CPI data for \"united states\"**\n```bash\nSELECT * FROM \"world_bank_cpi\".\"data\" WHERE \"country_name\" = 'united states';\n```\n\n**# compare CPI data for \"united states\" between year \"1965\" and \"2017\"**\n```bash\nSELECT \"country_name\", \"1965\", \"2017\" FROM \"world_bank_cpi\".\"data\" WHERE \"country_name\" = 'united states';\n```\n\n**# compare CPI data between \"united states\" and \"china\" for the 2017\"**\n```bash\nSELECT \"country_name\", \"2017\" FROM \"world_bank_cpi\".\"data\" WHERE \"country_name\" IN ('united states', 'china');\n```\n\n## Setup Amazon QuickSight to create visualizations on the CPI dataset\n\nBelow are the detailed steps to analyze CPI dataset using Amazon QuickSight\n- From your AWS Management Console, log onto Amazon QuickSight\n- Click `Manage data`\n- Click `New data set`\n- If you ran the provided CloudFormation template, you should already have your database and table with schema created in AWS Glue and Athena\n- Click on `Athena` to connect to your data source\n- Provide a name for your QuickSight `Data source name` and click `Create data source`\n- In the `Database: contain sets of table` dropdown, choose database as `world_bank_cpi` and under `Tables: contain the data you can visualize`, choose table as `data`\n- At this point, you can `Edit/Preview data` if you like\n- You can then click on `Select`\n- In the `Finish data set creation` screen, you can select `Visualize` to finish the creation of data set process\n- Visualize the CPI data set by selecting the `Horizontal bar chart` from the `Visual types`\n- Drag `country_name` field to the `Y axis` in `Field wells` and for e.g. drag `2017` field in the `Value` block to chart the data\n\nYou are now ready to start analyzing and visualizing the dataset.\n\n## Contact Information\nIf you have questions about the source data, please contact data@worldbank.org. If you have any questions about the CloudFormation stack, Lambda code or any of the AWS services being used, please contact data@rearc.io.\n\n## About Rearc\nRearc is a cloud, software and services company.

      "LongDescription": "Yields on Treasury nominal securities at \u201cconstant maturity\u201d are interpolated by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve for non-inflation-indexed Treasury securities. This curve, which relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. These market yields are calculated from composites of quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The constant maturity yield values are read from the yield curve at fixed maturities, currently 1, 3, and 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years. This method provides a yield for a 10-year maturity, for example, even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity. Similarly, yields on inflation-indexed securities at \u201cconstant maturity\u201d are interpolated from the daily yield curve for Treasury inflation protected securities in the over-the-counter market. The inflation-indexed constant maturity yields are read from this yield curve at fixed maturities, currently 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years.\n\nThis data is part of U.S. Government Work.

In S3, click on the cloudformation.yaml and copy the url from the `Object URL`\n- Now, from your AWS Management Console, log onto Amazon CloudFormation UI and click `Create Stack`\n- Under `Choose a template` either provide the template via uploading from local computer or specify the S3 object url and click `Next`\n- Provide a friendly stack name in the `Stack name` text box\n- In the `SourceS3Bucket` field, input the S3 bucket name that you chose earlier to store the treasury-maturities/automation/post-processing-code.zip file\n- Leave rest of the fields as is\n- Click `Next`\n- On the `Configure stack options` page, click `Next`\n- On the `Review test` page, checkmark the `I acknowledge...` boxes\n- Click `Create stack`\n\n### At a high level, CloudFormation will setup following resources automatically.\n- Lambda function to setup automatic AWS Data Exchange revision updates for this dataset\n- CloudWatch Event rule that will automatically trigger the Lambda function every time a new revision update is published\n- Analytics Lambda function to setup AWS Glue and Amazon Athena\n- Necessary IAM roles and permissions\n\nIf you are interested in looking at the AWS Lambda code or the CloudFormation template, feel free to inspect files inside `treasury-maturities/automation/post-processing-code.zip` and `treasury-maturities/automation/cloudformation.yaml`\n\n*Please note, the code for automatic daily revision updates runs in AWS Lambda using Python runtime. AWS Python SDK (boto3) that comes with the default Lambda Python runtime is currently not updated to support AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace Catalog APIs. Hence, we use a Lambda layer on top of the Lambda Python runtime that extends the AWS Python SDK (boto3) to support AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace Catalog APIs as of November 13, 2019. Once the Lambda Python runtime is updated with a newer version of AWS Python SDK (boto3), we will update the code to remove this Lambda layer.*\n\n## Using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena to run interactive queries against the dataset\n\nOnce the CloudFormation template is successfully deployed, the data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available on Athena. You can go to the Athena UI from the AWS Management Console and run SQL queries on the dataset.\n\n### Here are some sample Athena SQL queries you can try on the dataset.\n\n**# list daily 5 year treasury rate**\n```bash\nSELECT \"time_period\", \"5_year\" FROM \"treasurymaturities\".\"data\";\n```\n\n**# list all treasury data for a specific date**\n```bash\nSELECT * FROM \"treasurymaturities\".\"data\" WHERE \"time_period\" = date '2019-05-01';\n```\n\n**# compare 2 year and 5 year treasury rate for a specific date**\n```bash\nSELECT \"time_period\", \"2_year\", \"10_year\" FROM \"treasurymaturities\".\"data\" WHERE \"time_period\" = date '2019-05-01';\n```\n\n**# compare all treasury rates between 2 specific dates**\n```bash\nSELECT * FROM \"treasurymaturities\".\"data\" WHERE \"time_period\" IN (date '2000-05-01', date '2019-05-01');\n```\n\n## Setup Amazon QuickSight to create visualizations on the dataset\n\nBelow are the detailed steps to analyze dataset using Amazon QuickSight\n- From your AWS Management Console, log onto Amazon QuickSight\n- Click `Manage data`\n- Click `New data set`\n- If you ran the provided CloudFormation template, you should already have your database and table with schema created in AWS Glue and Athena\n- Click on `Athena` to connect to your data source\n- Provide a name for your QuickSight `Data source name` and click `Create data source`\n- In the `Database: contain sets of table` dropdown, choose database as `treasurymaturities` and under `Tables: contain the data you can visualize`, choose table as `data`\n- At this point, you can `Edit/Preview data` if you like\n- You can then click on `Select`\n- In the `Finish data set creation` screen, you can select `Visualize` to finish the creation of data set process\n- Visualize the data set by selecting the `Line chart` from the `Visual types`\n- Drag `time_period` field to the `X axis` in `Field wells` and for e.g. drag `5_year` field in the `Value` block with `Aggregate` equals `Average` to chart the data\n\nYou are now ready to start analyzing and visualizing the dataset.\n\n# Contact Information\nIf you have questions about the source data, please contact [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/contactus/feedback.aspx). If you have any questions about the CloudFormation stack, Lambda code or any of the AWS services being used, please contact data@rearc.io.\n\n## About Rearc\nRearc is a cloud, software and services company.

      "LongDescription": "The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is available at [https://github.com/rearc-data/usa-hospital-beds](https://github.com/rearc-data/usa-hospital-beds).\n\n## Main Description\nThis resource includes data on numbers of licensed beds, staffed beds, ICU beds, and the bed utilization rate for the hospitals in the United States.\n\n## Product Description\nThis resource includes data on numbers of licensed beds, staffed beds, ICU beds, and the bed utilization rate for the hospitals in the United States.\n\n### Data Sources\nThis dataset is intended to be used as a baseline for understanding the typical bed capacity and average yearly bed utilization of hospitals reporting such information. The date of last update received from each hospital may be varied. While the dataset is not updated in real-time, this information is critical for understanding the impact of a high utilization event, like COVID-19.\n\nPlease see the following for more details about each metric in the dataset:\n\n**Number of Licensed beds:**  is the maximum number of beds for which a hospital holds a license to operate; however, many hospitals do not operate all the beds for which they are licensed. This number is obtained through DHC Primary Research. Licensed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of licensed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System.\n\n**Number of Staffed Bed:**  is defined as an \"adult bed, pediatric bed, birthing room, or newborn ICU bed (excluding newborn bassinets) maintained in a patient care area for lodging patients in acute, long term, or domiciliary areas of the hospital.\"  Beds in labor room, birthing room, post-anesthesia, postoperative recovery rooms, outpatient areas, emergency rooms, ancillary departments, nurses and other staff residences, and other such areas which are regularly maintained and utilized for only a portion of the stay of patients (primarily for special procedures or not for inpatient lodging) are not termed a bed for these purposes.  Definitive Healthcare sources Staffed Bed data from the Medicare Cost Report or Proprietary Research as needed. As with all Medicare Cost Report metrics, this number is self-reported by providers. Staffed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of staffed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System.  Total number of staffed beds in the US should exclude Hospital Systems to avoid double counting.  ICU beds are likely to follow the same logic as a subset of Staffed beds.\n\n**Number of ICU Beds - ICU (Intensive Care Unit) Beds:**  are qualified based on definitions by CMS, Section 2202.7, 22-8.2. These beds include ICU beds, burn ICU beds, surgical ICU beds, premature ICU beds, neonatal ICU beds, pediatric ICU beds, psychiatric ICU beds, trauma ICU beds, and Detox ICU beds.\n\n**Bed Utilization Rate:**   is calculated based on metrics from the Medicare Cost Report: Bed Utilization Rate = Total Patient Days (excluding nursery days)/Bed Days Available\n\n**Potential Increase in Bed Capacity:** This metric is computed by subtracting \u201cNumber of Staffed Beds from Number of Licensed beds\u201d (Licensed Beds \u2013 Staffed Beds). This would provide insights into scenario planning for when staff can be shifted around to increase available bed capacity as needed.\n\n**Hospital Definition:**  Definitive Healthcare defines a hospital as a healthcare institution providing inpatient, therapeutic, or rehabilitation services under the supervision of physicians. In order for a facility to be considered a hospital it must provide inpatient care.\n\n*Hospital types are defined by the last four digits of the hospital\u2019s Medicare Provider Number. If the hospital does not have a Medicare Provider Number, Definitive Healthcare determines the Hospital type by proprietary research.*\n\n### Hospital Types\n\n#### Short Term Acute Care Hospital (STAC)\n- Provides inpatient care and other services for surgery, acute medical conditions, or injuries\n- Patients care can be provided overnight, and average length of stay is less than 25 days\n\n#### Critical Access Hospital (CAH)\n- 25 or fewer acute care inpatient beds\n- Located more than 35 miles from another hospital\n- Annual average length of stay is 96 hours or less for acute care patients\n- Must provide 24/7 emergency care services\n- Designation by CMS to reduce financial vulnerability of rural hospitals and improve access to healthcare\n- Religious Non-Medical Health Care Institutions\n- Provide nonmedical health care items and services to people who need hospital or skilled nursing facility care, but for whom that care would be inconsistent with their religious beliefs\n\n#### Long Term Acute Care Hospitals\n- Average length of stay is more than 25 days\n- Patients are receiving acute care - services often include respiratory therapy, head trauma treatment, and pain management\n- Rehabilitation Hospitals\n- Specializes in improving or restoring patients' functional abilities through therapies\n\n#### Children\u2019s Hospitals\n- Majority of inpatients under 18 years old\n\n#### Psychiatric Hospitals\n- Provides inpatient services for diagnosis and treatment of mental illness 24/7\n- Under the supervision of a physician\n\n#### Veteran's Affairs (VA) Hospital\n- Responsible for the care of war veterans and other retired military personnel\n- Administered by the U.S. VA, and funded by the federal government\n\n#### Department of Defense (DoD) Hospital\n- Provides care for military service people (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard), their dependents, and retirees (not all military service retirees are eligible for VA services)\n\n## More Information\n- [Source | Definitive Healthcare: USA Hospital Beds](https://coronavirus-disasterresponse.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/definitivehc::definitive-healthcare-usa-hospital-beds)\n- [Definitive Healthcare | Homepage](https://www.definitivehc.com)\n- Frequency: Daily\n- Formats: GeoJSON, CSV\n\n## Contact Details\n- If you find any issues with or have enhancement ideas for this product, open up a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/rearc-data/usa-hospital-beds/issues) and we will gladly take a look at it.
